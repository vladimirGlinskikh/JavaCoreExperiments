        C. Only three options
        D. Only four options
        E. All five options*/

       /* Reason :
        Top-level class can use only two access modifiers [public and
        default(don't specify anything)]. private and protected cannot be
        used.
        As file name is M.java, hence class N cannot be public .
        Top-level class can be final, hence it is a correct option.
        Top-level class can be abstract and hence it is also a correct option.*/
